# rougelike-game

## Requirements
minifb static library - libminifb.a
x11
openGL
clang with ASAN
maketools

## X11 only support
This projects is designed for X11-gl only. I do however plan on adding multiple platforms later on, main reason being that I would like to keep the project simple, stable, well tested and easy to manage.

I do believe, if one were to add the right headers & build libminifb for another platform it will work.

## Goal
This repo is mainly supposed to be for me to practice coding
